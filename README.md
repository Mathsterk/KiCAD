# KiCad
Random projects

remember to unzip submodules (OPL)

remember to add proper library path (../../Library)

remember something else as well

remember to use relative paths

## projects
  this is where you put projects


##Library
  this is where libraries go, both component and footprints


## tools
  where random scripts and stuff lives


##board assemblies
  this is where 3d-ifyed stuff can live, preferrably within ./<project name>/<3d-files>
