# KiCad
**Random projects**

remember to unzip submodules (OPL)
remember to add proper library path (../../Library)
remember something else as well
remember to use relative paths

## Projects
  this is where you put projects


## Library

  this is where libraries go, both component and footprints


## Tools
  where random scripts and stuff lives


## Board assemblies
  this is where 3d-ifyed stuff can live, preferrably within ./\<project name>/<3d-files>
